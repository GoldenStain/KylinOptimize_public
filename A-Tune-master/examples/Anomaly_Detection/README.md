# Anomaly-Detection 

## Project Information

【Project Full Name】：Operating system-oriented intelligent anomaly detection scheme

【Background】：An operating system is loaded with various application software. An operating system failure may lead to serious accidents. Therefore, it is of great significance to detect potential anomalies in the operating system quickly and accurately. Based performance indicators of the operating system in real time, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network delay, and uses intelligent detection algorithms to accurately analyze operating system exceptions,this project build a complete testing process and design efficient and intelligent anomaly detection algorithms.
